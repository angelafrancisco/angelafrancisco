### Hello! I'm Angela ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer with a background in relational database administration. Iâ€™m passionate about the details and building scaleable, responsive, and accessible applications. Some of my favorite technologies to work with recently are React.js, Node.js, and CSS/SCSS. 

After pivoting from ten years in the nonprofit sector, I have a strong foundation in analyzing problems, maintaining complex systems and facilitating cross-team collaboration.
