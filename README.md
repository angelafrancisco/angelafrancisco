### Hello! I'm Angela ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer by day, cozy bookworm by night. I started coding as a kid, learning html and css to customize my *~ vErY cOoL ~* MySpace page.

My focus is in frontend, primarily in React and TypeScript. I love building interfaces at the intersection of beautiful design and accessibility for all.

After working over a decade in the nonprofit sector, specializing in database administration, I took a creative leap to pursue a career in web development. I bring a passion for growing my knowledge in new technologies and patience in finding the missing pieces in a puzzle.

Offline, you'll find me reading fantasy books, exploring my neighborhood by bike, or snuggling with my chiweenie pup Luya.
