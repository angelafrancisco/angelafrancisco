### Hi, I'm Angela! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a background in relational databases. I strive to use my knowledge for social good and hold community at the center of my work.  

Offline, you'll find me reading fantasy books, exploring my neighborhood by bike, or snuggling with my chiweenie dog.
